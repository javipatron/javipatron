### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Im Javier

I'm currently persuing a Master of Environmental Data Science degree at the Bren School at UCSB. IÂ´m learning how to address environmental problems with data science techniques using R and Python. I'm particularly interested in climate change mitigation strategies, like nature-based solutions and carbon offset projects.
